 <h1>Paris Wolfe</h1>
 <p>Hello! My name is Paris Wolfe and I am a student at UWI. I enjoying working out, reading comics/graphic novels like Batman:Year One and Scott Pilgrim and  playing video games like Valorant, League of Legends and Baldurs Gate (I'm currently trying to 100% Bg3 and im almost done). I have a deep love for cats and last year I finally got one; His name is Hiroshima. I enjoy making and designing websites and I believe I will like this course just as much as I liked Web Dev 1. <3</p>
